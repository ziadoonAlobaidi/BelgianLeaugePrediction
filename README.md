### Belgian League Match Prediction Challenge  

As part of a **BeCode class challenge**, our team developed a machine learning project to scrape and analyze Belgian League match statistics, aiming to predict the results of the next week's matches. At the end of the challenge, our model accurately predicted almost all match outcomes, leading us to win the competition.

**Team Roles:**  
- **Data Analysts:** Me, Rachel
- **Data Engineers:** [Laura](https://github.com/KriszgruberL), [Alisher](https://github.com/AlisherJard) 

On this project i worked on processing data recieved from Data Engineers team and on features engineering, and machine learning, to predict next week's matches
